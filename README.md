Zahra Etebari – AI Portfolio Chatbot

 Chat with My AI Projects

Meet my AI Portfolio Chatbot — an intelligent assistant that can answer questions about my Speech Recognition, Computer Vision, and Data Mining projects, along with insights about my tech stack and AI expertise.

It’s built using FastAPI, Sentence Transformers, and FAISS, combining conversational intelligence with a retrieval-based knowledge system — so recruiters and collaborators can chat directly with my portfolio.

 What You Can Ask

💬 “How did you build your Speech Recognition model?”
💬 “What framework did you use for Object Detection?”
💬 “What metrics did you evaluate your models with?”
💬 “Tell me about your background in AI.”

 Tech Stack Overview
Component	Description
Backend Framework	FastAPI (Python)
Retrieval Engine	Sentence Transformers + FAISS
Frontend	Minimal HTML/JS Chat Interface
Hosting Options	Render / Hugging Face Spaces
Knowledge Base	Curated project READMEs + notes
